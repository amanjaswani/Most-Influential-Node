# Most-Influential-Node
Identifying that nodes and edges play a crucial role in a network is of great importance. Generally the basic idea is to classify the nodes and edges in a network with the highest criticality. As a result, the centrality principle has been studied extensively and in great detail, focusing on creating a consistent and accurate location of nodes within a network in terms of their importance. Single centrality measures suffer from an inevitable disadvantage due to the failure to recognize the effects when considered in groups on node functionality. Apparently, group centrality places great focus on operating in groups of nodes and not on their individual functionalities. Nonetheless, group centrality suffers from a drawback by focusing on a- priori-determined node groups and contributing to confusion when prioritizing individual nodes within the network. Shapley suggested that individual marginal contribution should be measured for a given player as the weighted average marginal increase in the yield of any coalition that this player might join. Shapley has shown that this principle, known as the value of Shapley, is the only division scheme that satisfies certain desirable standard properties.
